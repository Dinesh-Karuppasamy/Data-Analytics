## Data Cleaning
The data is imported and checked troughly for any irregularities and the dirty data is cleaned for smooth exploration .

The irrelevant columns are dropped and column names are renamed to aid exploration.

## Data Exploration 
The data is explored to find relationships and insights on ,

1.What is the percentage of no-show?

2.What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?

3.Is the time gender related to whether a patient will show or not?

7.Does age affect whether a patient will show up or not?

# Key Insights
The data is explored and insights are provided with appropriate visualisations,

1.Percentage of patients who didn't show up for their appointment is 20.19%.

2.The percentage of females missing their appointment is nearly two 
times the number of males. So females are more likely to miss their 
appointment.

to miss their appointment.
