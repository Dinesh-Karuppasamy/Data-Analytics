I conducted a data analysis project on hospitals in India, analyzing the number of hospitals, general beds, and ICU beds in India.

## Data Cleaning

Thorough checking and data cleaning was conducted to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the dataset.

State names were made consistent.

Information for Ladakh was incomplete or missing, which was ignored during the exploration.

MS Excel was used for data cleaning.

## Data Exploration 

Data was explored to find insights on the total number of hospitals, general beds, and ICU beds in the Indian states and top 10 cities.
Tableau was used for data exploration.

Filters were applied to pick top 10 cities from data.

General beds were found by employing a calculated field which found the difference between total beds and ICU beds.
