# KPMG-Virtual-Internship
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy. 

**Tools used**- MS Excel , Tableau

## Tasks

**Task 1 - Data Quality Assessment**

The client has asked to assess the quality of their data, as well as make recommendations on ways to clean the underlying data and mitigate these issues.

The dataset is evaluated in the framework of data qulaity standards i.e Accuracy,Completeness,Consistency,Relevancy,Validity and Uniqueness and the dirty data is cleaned for smooth exploration.

**Task 2 - Data Insights**

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has given us a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. However, these customers do not have prior transaction history with the organisation. 

The marketing team at Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is sure that, if correctly analysed, the existing 3 datasets would reveal useful customer insights which could help optimise resource allocation for targeted marketing. Hence, improve performance by focusing on high value customers.

The data is explored to find useful insights on targeting customers.
